    The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

    As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}, the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

    Here is the output schema:

    The debate motion is: {{ info.motion }}

    Pro side debaters are: {{ info.pro_side|map(attribute='name')|join(', ') }}

    Con side debaters are: {{ info.con_side|map(attribute='name')|join(', ') }}

    The debate consists of {{ info.speech_order|length }} speeches.

    This is a British Parliamentary style debate: the debaters' names are abbreviations of Opening/Closing Government/Opposition respectively; OG and OO first give 4 speeches in turn, then CG and CO give another 4 speeches in turn.

    Note that debaters have different roles to play in the debate:

    - OG should define the motion and advance arguments in favour of their side; in speech 3 they should also rebut arguments made by OO.
    - OO should rebut OG's case and advance constructive arguments as to why their side of the table should win the debate.
    - CG, in speech 5, should provide further analysis in favour of the motion, which should be consistent with, but distinct from, the substantive material advanced by OG. Further analysis can take the form of substantive material, refutation, framing, characterization, or any kind of material meant to advance the Government case; however, in speech 7, they should summarize the debate, showing why their side should win the debate, without adding any new arguments to their cases.
    - CO is similar to CG but against the motion: in speech 6, they should provide further analysis meant to advance the Opposition case, which should be consistent with, but distinct from, the substantive material advanced by OO; in speech 8, they should summarize the debate, showing why their side should win the debate, without adding any new arguments to their cases.

    During a speech, debaters on the other side can ask to offer a Point of Information (POI) --- a question or comment designed to challenge the speaker's argument. The speaker can choose to accept or reject the request; if they accept, the offerer then makes the POI and the speaker should respond to this challenge. POIs can be seen as a type of engagement, but receiving no POIs should not be penalized for a lack of engagement.

    The speeches are transcribed from oral speech audio, and may contain errors due to inaccurate speech recognition. You should tolerate these errors and instead focus on the content.
